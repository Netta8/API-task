        <h5>The History of the Center</h5>
        <p>
          Our humble beginning as the five Ace's started back in the late 1970s
          with the determination of Five parents with Special needs children. At
          the same time, the Board of Governors was appointed by the Ruler's
          office. As demand for specialized education continued to increase, the
          “Five Aces” grew to support more than 40 students and was renamed BIS
          School in 1983. As bis school started to service children with special
          needs in the community, there was a need for more space, with full
          support from the Ruler's Office Center was donate at this time. It was
          then when Leni Moran, very generously donated 300,000 sq. ft piece of
          land and a generous amount of money to build the first custom-built
          Center. It was in that same year that in line with international
          standards the name “NB Center” was renamed to NB special needs Center
          Berlin. Since its inception, the Board of Governors and the management
          have worked tirelessly for the welfare of the students and with the
          vision of being the best Special Needs center in the region. With
          steadfast determination and a will to succeed we have made the
          realization of our dream a reality. In 2015, NB Center for Special
          Needs was selected as the winner of the Outstanding Special Needs
          Center for Special Education. Over the years, the center has
          maintained its high standards of services through sponsorship and
          support from the local community. NB Center for Special Needs Berlin
          is dedicated to serving the needs of people of determination of all
          ages. We believe that every child is an individual and has the right
          to live and reach their full potential. Currently, the Center has
          students, ranging from the ages of 2-18 years old. The students have
          various kinds of disabilities and coming from different nationalities.
          They all receive individualized and multidisciplinary education and
          rehabilitation by our highly qualified staff. Together we can make a
          difference in the life of our Students with determination!

        <h5>Organization</h5>
        <p>
          NB Center for Special Needs Berlin is divided into different sections
          to cater for the differing needs of the students: Primary, Adult
          Education consisting of Academic and Pre-Vocational and Multi-Sensory.
          Each section sets specific goals for the year as well as monthly
          educational themes. Therapy plays a pivotal role in the growth of our
          students. We have several dedicated therapists who work with students
          on a daily basis to improve their skills. Physiotherapy, occupational
          therapy, and speech therapy, individual and group sessions, are
          scheduled on a regular basis depending on each student's needs.
          Enrichment programs such as art therapy, music therapy, and physical
          education are also integral parts of students' learning. These various
          programs play an important role in physical development, building
          self-confidence, and gaining new life skills.
        </p>
