# REACT-special.needs.Center-Project

In this project, I created a website for a special needs center in Berlin using React. 
I crafted unique components tailored to each class offered at the center, seamlessly integrated with an enrollment form. 
Building the application,I harnessed the power of React hooks and React Router to enhance functionality and navigation.
